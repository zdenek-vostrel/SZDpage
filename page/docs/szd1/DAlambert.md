# D'Alambert Strategy

The d'Alembert strategy is a betting system often used in gambling. It is named after the French mathematician Jean le Rond d'Alembert. The strategy is based on the idea of balancing wins and losses, and it is considered a more conservative approach compared to other betting systems like the Martingale.

### How the d'Alembert Strategy Works

1. **Initial Bet**: You start with a base bet, which is the amount you choose to wager initially.
    
2. **Increasing Bets**: If you lose a bet, you increase your next bet by one unit. For example, if your base bet is $10 and you lose, your next bet would be $20.
    
3. **Decreasing Bets**: If you win a bet, you decrease your next bet by one unit. So, if you win after betting $20, your next bet would return to $10.
    
4. **Goal**: The goal of the d'Alembert strategy is to achieve a balance between wins and losses over time, with the idea that the number of wins and losses will eventually even out.
